      "question": "How does merge sort work?",
      "expected_answer": "Merge sort divides array into halves, recursively sorts them, then merges sorted halves",
      "actual_answer": "Merge sort works by following the divide-and0x4a+;/divide-andconquer paradigm. The sequence to be sorted is divided into two subsequences of2 elements each (as stated in source [Cormen - Introduction to Algorithms, Page 51]). These smaller subproblems are then solved recursively using the merge sort algorithm itself ([source: Cormen - Introduction to Algorithms, Pages 37 and 61]). Once sorted individually, these subsequences are merged into a single sequence in order (as per source [Cormen - Introduction to Algorithms, Page 51]). The 'combine' step involves merging two smaller sorted sequences back together using an auxiliary procedure called MERGE ([source: Cormen - Introduction to Algorithms, Pages 37 and 61]), where the assumption is that each of these subarrays are already in a state of being individually sorted. Merge sort continues this process until reaching base cases (sequences with length = 1), which by definition are themselves ordered and therefore do not require further sorting actions ([source: Cormen - Introduction to Algorithms, Pages 37 and 61]).",

The actual answer provides more detail about how subsequences are divided (into halves of two elements each), but it still conveys that these smaller sequences will be sorted recursively using merge sort itself before being merged back together in order by the MERGE procedure, which is consistent with the expected description provided as a reference. The actual answer also touches upon base cases and auxiliary procedures like 'MERGE', while maintaining semantic equivalence to the core information about how merge sort works overall.",

      "expected_answer": "Average case O(n log n), worst case O(n\u00b2)",
      "actual_answer": "The time complexity of quicksort is O(n log n) in the average and best cases. In the worst case, it has a quadratic running time of O(n^2), which occurs when the smallest or largest element is always chosen as the pivot (asymptotically speaking). However, with randomized versions such as RANDOMIZED -QUICKSORT that employ strategies to avoid consistently poor pivots, we expect a more robust O(n log n) running time.\n\nTo cite this information: [Source: Cormen - Introduction to Algorithms, Page 191] and [Source: Cormen - Introduction to Algorithms, Pages 201 & 202].",

      "explanation": "Both answers convey the same essential information regarding quicksort' end time complexities. The first answer succinctly states these as O(n log n) for average and worst cases, while also mentioning that randomized versions can avoid consistently poor pivots to maintain this complexity more often. This is consistent with what the second detailed explanation provides: it discusses how quicksort's performance varies based on pivot selection (average case O(n log n), worst-case quadratic time) and introduces a solution for mitigating bad cases through randomized strategies, which aligns well with Cormen\u2019s sources. The key concepts of average/worst-case complexities are addressed in both answers; the second answer provides additional context but does not contradict or significantly deviate from the first one's information regarding time complexity and pivot selection strategy",

      "actual_answer": "A binary search tree (BST) is a data structure organized in the form of a binary tree. In this tree, each node contains a key and satellite data along with pointers to its left child, right child, and parent. The keys within any given node's subtree are strictly ordered: all keys in the left subtree are less than or equal to the node's key (in an example of max-heap), while all keys in the right subtree are greater than or equal to it. These properties allow for efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations within the tree [Cormen - Introduction to Algorithms, Page 308].",

      "actual_answer": "Dynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems.

This approach typically applies when dealing with optimization problems that can have multiple possible solutions, where we are interested in finding an optimal solution\u2014that is, one with either the minimum or maximum value. Dynamic programming involves characterizing the structure of an optimal solution (Step 1), recursively defining its value based on subproblems' values (Step 2), and computing these values typically using a bottom-up approach to avoid recomputation. Finally, constructing an explicit optimal solution from computed information might be done if required (Step 4).

According to Cormen - Introduction to Algorithms on Page 178, this ensures both children of nodei are roots of max-heaps. Then by decrementing `i`, we reestablish the loop invariant for the next iteration in line with what's outlined from lines 2 through 5 as part of HEAPSORT on Page 181, which maintains that each remaining node is a root of a max-heap.\n\nReferences:\n- Cormen - Introduction to Algorithms, Pages 178 and 181",
