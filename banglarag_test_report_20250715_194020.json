      "actual_answer": "NP-completeness is a class of problems in computational complexity theory that are known to be at least as difficult as the hardest problems in NP, which is the set of all decision problems for which there exists a polynomial-time algorithm that always returns the correct answer. This means that if a problem can be solved in polynomial time, then it is in NP, and if a problem is in NP, then it is NP-complete. The class NP-completeness was introduced by Garey and Johnson in 1979 as a way to classify problems that are at least as hard as the hardest problems in NP. It is an important concept in computer science, as it provides a framework for understanding the limits of computational resources and the power of algorithms.",
