      "expected_answer": "Merge sort divides array into halves, recursively sorts them, then merges sorted halves",
      "actual_answer": "Merge Sort operates based on the divide-and-conquer paradigm. The steps to perform a Merge Sort are as follows:\n\nDivide: Start by dividing the given sequence into two subsequences of equal length (n/2 elements each). This process continues recursively until every subsequence has only one element, which is inherently sorted on its own since any single-element array or list can be considered to already be in a 'sorted' state.\n\nConquer: Sort the individual smaller sequences using Merge sort itself; this recursive approach ensures that all these subsequences are properly arranged by repeatedly dividing and sorting until they become sufficiently small (individual elements). \n\nCombine: Finally, merge those sorted subarrays back together to produce a single sequence in which everything is ordered from the smallest to largest. This step involves an auxiliary procedure called MERGE that takes into account three indices p, q, and r referring to different parts of one array (A) being merged with another already-sorted portion A\u0152q : r \u008d; this merge operation assumes both subarrays are sorted as per the divide phase.\n\nIn summary, Merge Sort works by dividing a sequence into smaller sequences that can be individually sorted and then merging them back together in order to form one fully sorted sequence. The process is done recursively until we reach individual elements which do not need sorting any further.",

      "explanation": "Both answers describe the Merge Sort algorithm's process, which includes dividing an array into halves (or subsequences), recursively sorting these smaller parts using the same sort methodology until they are single-element arrays or lists that can be considered sorted. Then both descriptions mention merging those sorted elements back together to form a fully ordered sequence. The actual answer provides more detail about how Merge Sort operates, including specifics on dividing and conquering recursively as well as the merge process with indices p, q, r; however, it does not change the fundamental understanding of what Merge Sort is or its steps that are conveyed in both answers. The key concepts regarding division into halves (or subsequences), recursive sorting, and merging back together to form a sorted sequence remain consistent across both descriptions.",

      "actual_answer": "The worst-case running time of QuickSort and its variant Randomized QuickSort, which occurs when the smallest or largest element is always chosen as the pivot, results in a quadratic time complexity denoted by O(n^2). However, this situation can be avoided using various strategies to choose better pivots.
