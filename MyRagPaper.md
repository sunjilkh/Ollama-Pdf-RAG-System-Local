### Abstract

We present BanglaRAG, the first explainable, page-citing textbook chatbot for Bangla and English educational content. Our system combines domain-adaptive retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with multimodal (text and voice) input, automatic language detection, and verifiable page-level citations. By integrating BanglaBERT, Whisper ASR, and a teacher-centric document management workflow, BanglaRAG enables students and educators to ask natural questions and receive trustworthy, source-cited answers from their own textbooks. Extensive experiments demonstrate high QA and citation accuracy, robust Bangla/English support, and significant performance gains over prior RAG baselines.

### Introduction

The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in education has enabled new forms of interactive learning, but most systems lack explainability and support for low-resource languages like Bangla. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks [1] and dense passage retrieval [2] have advanced open-domain QA, but verifiable, evidence-based QA remains a challenge [3]. For teachers and students, trust in AI answers is criticalâ€”especially when using domain-specific textbooks. Recent work on explainable QA [3], page-level citation [4], and multilingual models [5] has begun to address these gaps, but few systems support Bangla or multimodal (voice/text) queries [5], [6]. Furthermore, teacher-centric document management and usability are often overlooked [7].

To address these gaps, we introduce BanglaRAG, an explainable textbook chatbot with:

1. **Domain-Adaptive Bangla RAG**: Mixed-language retrieval and answer generation using BanglaBERT [5] and English models.
2. **Multimodal Bangla Educational QA**: Seamless support for both text and voice queries via Whisper ASR [6].
3. **Page-Level Explainability in RAG**: Every answer is accompanied by a verifiable page-level citation [4].
4. **Teacher-Centric Document Management**: Simple PDF upload and management for educators [7].

Our system is the first to unify these features for Bangla education, providing accurate, explainable, and trustworthy answers with direct links to textbook pages.

#### Literature Review

The most closely related works to BanglaRAG are those that combine retrieval-augmented generation with explainability and multilingual support. Lewis et al. [1] and Karpukhin et al. [2] laid the foundation for RAG and dense retrieval, while Saha et al. [5] and Sarker et al. [8] advanced Bangla NLP with BanglaBERT and new benchmarks. Zhang et al. [3] and Wang et al. [4] directly address verifiable, evidence-based QA and page-level citation, which are central to our system. Radford et al. [6] and Alam et al. [9] provide the ASR backbone for our multimodal pipeline.

Relatively close works include those extending RAG to low-resource languages [10], improving domain-specific retrieval [11], and reducing hallucination via retrieval [12]. Liu et al. [13] and Islam et al. [14] explore multimodal and Bangla educational chatbots, while Sultana et al. [7] and Chowdhury et al. [15] focus on teacher-centric design and document managementâ€”key for our workflow.

Other foundational works, such as Rajpurkar et al. [16], Devlin et al. [17], Brown et al. [18], and Kiela et al. [19], have shaped the broader landscape of explainable QA, LLMs, and evaluation. While not directly focused on Bangla or page-level citation, their contributions underpin the advances made in BanglaRAG and similar systems.
