### Abstract

We present BanglaRAG, the first explainable, page-citing textbook chatbot for Bangla and English educational content. Our system combines domain-adaptive retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with multimodal (text and voice) input, automatic language detection, and verifiable page-level citations. By integrating BanglaBERT, Whisper ASR, and a teacher-centric document management workflow, BanglaRAG enables students and educators to ask natural questions and receive trustworthy, source-cited answers from their own textbooks. Extensive experiments demonstrate high QA and citation accuracy, robust Bangla/English support, and significant performance gains over prior RAG baselines.

### Introduction

The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in education has enabled new forms of interactive learning, but most systems lack explainability and support for low-resource languages like Bangla. For teachers and students, trust in AI answers is criticalâ€”especially when using domain-specific textbooks. Existing RAG systems rarely provide verifiable citations, and almost none support Bangla or multimodal (voice/text) queries. Furthermore, teachers need easy ways to upload and manage their own materials.

To address these gaps, we introduce BanglaRAG, an explainable textbook chatbot with:

1. **Domain-Adaptive Bangla RAG**: Mixed-language retrieval and answer generation using BanglaBERT and English models.
2. **Multimodal Bangla Educational QA**: Seamless support for both text and voice queries via Whisper ASR.
3. **Page-Level Explainability in RAG**: Every answer is accompanied by a verifiable page-level citation.
4. **Teacher-Centric Document Management**: Simple PDF upload and management for educators.

Our system is the first to unify these features for Bangla education, providing accurate, explainable, and trustworthy answers with direct links to textbook pages.

#### Literature Review

The most closely related works to BanglaRAG are those that combine retrieval-augmented generation with explainability and multilingual support. Lewis et al. (2020) and Karpukhin et al. (2020) laid the foundation for RAG and dense retrieval, while Saha et al. (2021) and Sarker et al. (2022) advanced Bangla NLP with BanglaBERT and new benchmarks. Zhang et al. (2022) and Wang et al. (2022) directly address verifiable, evidence-based QA and page-level citation, which are central to our system. Radford et al. (2023) and Alam et al. (2022) provide the ASR backbone for our multimodal pipeline.

Relatively close works include those extending RAG to low-resource languages (De et al. 2022), improving domain-specific retrieval (Lee et al. 2021), and reducing hallucination via retrieval (Shuster et al. 2021). Liu et al. (2023) and Islam et al. (2023) explore multimodal and Bangla educational chatbots, while Sultana et al. (2023) and Chowdhury et al. (2023) focus on teacher-centric design and document managementâ€”key for our workflow.

Other foundational works, such as Rajpurkar et al. (2016), Devlin et al. (2019), Brown et al. (2020), and Kiela et al. (2021), have shaped the broader landscape of explainable QA, LLMs, and evaluation. While not directly focused on Bangla or page-level citation, their contributions underpin the advances made in BanglaRAG and similar systems.
